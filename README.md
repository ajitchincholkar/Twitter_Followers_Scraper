# Twitter Followers Scraper
A simple script to scrape Followers and Bio of the followers of any Twitter user.

I have used Selenium Webdriver for automation of the login process as well as navigating to the mentioned user's followers page and scraping the followers and bio of the user.

## How to use
1. First you need the required packages for the script to run
- csv
- getpass
- Selenium
2. Add your email ID and Twitter username (one that starts with @) in the mentioned places in the code.
3. Also, enter the Twitter username of the user whose followers you want to scrape in the mentioned places in the code.
4. That's it, now run the code and let the scraper do it's job.
